A chatbot, also referred to as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity, represents a computer program or an artificial intelligence designed to engage in conversation through auditory or textual means. These programs are often meticulously crafted to emulate human behavior convincingly, aiming to pass the Turing test. Chatbots find widespread applications in dialog systems for various practical purposes such as customer service or information retrieval. While some chatterbots employ sophisticated natural language processing systems, simpler ones often rely on scanning for keywords within input and providing replies based on matching keywords or similar wording patterns retrieved from a database.

The term "ChatterBot" was initially coined by Michael Mauldin (the creator of the first Verbot, Julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs. Today, most chatbots are accessible via virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat, or through individual organizations' apps and websites. Chatbots can be categorized into various usage domains including conversational commerce, analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, HR, marketing, news, personal assistance, productivity, shopping, social interactions, sports, travel, and utilities.

In 1950, Alan Turing introduced the Turing test as a measure of intelligence in his renowned article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." This test evaluates a computer program's ability to simulate human conversation to the extent that a human judge cannot reliably distinguish between the program and a real human in a real-time written conversation. Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, introduced in 1966, garnered significant attention as it seemed capable of deceiving users into believing they were conversing with a human. However, Weizenbaum himself never claimed ELIZA possessed genuine intelligence. Instead, he presented it as a debunking exercise, revealing that the program's workings were merely procedural rather than truly intelligent.

ELIZA's methodology, which involved recognizing cue words or phrases in input and providing pre-prepared responses, has been replicated by chatbot designers since then. This approach creates an illusion of understanding, despite the underlying processing being superficial. ELIZA demonstrated the ease with which such an illusion could be generated, exploiting humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational. Interface designers have realized the potential of chatbot-style techniques in interactive systems to engage users more effectively, particularly in eliciting information, thus potentially elevating chatbot technology from a mere curiosity to genuinely useful computational methods.

Historically, early chatbots like ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972) were significant. More recent examples include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky, and D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While early chatbots like ELIZA and PARRY were limited to simulating typed conversations, modern chatbots often include functional features such as games and web search capabilities.

Natural language processing is a pertinent field of AI research. Typically, weak AI fields utilize specialized software or programming languages tailored to their specific functions. For instance, A.L.I.C.E. employs a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its role as a conversational agent. However, A.L.I.C.E. relies solely on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, similar to ELIZA's approach in 1966. This falls short of strong AI, which necessitates sapience and logical reasoning abilities.

Jabberwacky stands out for its ability to learn new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than relying on a static database. Some recent chatbots combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms to optimize their communication abilities based on each conversation held. However, there's currently no general-purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some developers focus on practical aspects like information retrieval.

Chatbot competitions typically revolve around the Turing test or specific goals. Notable examples include the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge. According to Forrester (2015), AI is projected to replace 16 percent of American jobs by the end of the decade. Chatbots have found applications in customer service, sales, product education, and more. Despite concerns, a study by Narrative Science in 2015 found that 80 percent of respondents believed AI improves worker performance and creates jobs.

Chatbots are deployed across various platforms, including messaging apps like Facebook Messenger (since 2016), WeChat (since 2013), WhatsApp, LiveChat, Kik, Slack, Line, and Telegram. They serve purposes ranging from B2C customer service to sales and marketing. Facebook Messenger alone saw the creation of 30,000 bots in the first six months after allowing developers to integrate chatbots in 2016, increasing to 100,000 by September 2017.

Companies across industries, including banking, insurance, media, e-commerce, airlines, hotels, retail, healthcare, government, and restaurants, have utilized chatbots to answer inquiries, enhance customer engagement, promote products, and facilitate orders. A 2017 study indicated that 4% of companies used chatbots, with 80% of businesses intending to deploy one by 2020.

Apart from messaging apps, chatbots have been integrated into company websites and internal platforms for various purposes like customer support, HR, and IoT projects. Major corporations such as Overstock.com, Lloyds Banking Group, and Royal Bank of Scotland leverage chatbots to automate processes and improve efficiency. Startups are exploring AI-driven self-learning chatbots to reduce maintenance costs and enhance performance, especially in customer service applications.

The chatbot development process encompasses design, building, analytics, and maintenance phases. Design involves defining the chatbot's personality, interaction flow, and user testing. Building entails understanding user intent and generating appropriate responses, often involving Natural Language Processing. Analytics help monitor chatbot usage and gather insights for improvements. Maintenance ensures chatbots remain up-to-date with evolving products and services, either through ongoing service providers or in-house teams.

Chatbot development platforms offered by cloud providers such as Yekaliva, Oracle Cloud Platform, SnatchBot, and IBM Watson facilitate the creation, testing, and deployment of chatbots. These platforms offer capabilities like Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Mobile Backend as a Service. Additionally, APIs like AARC are available for building custom chatbots.

Unfortunately, malicious chatbots are a concern, frequently used to spam chat rooms or deceive individuals into revealing personal information. They mimic human behavior and conversations, posing risks in various online platforms, including messaging protocols and dating services.

In summary, chatbots represent a significant advancement in AI-driven conversational agents, finding extensive applications across industries for customer interaction, sales, support, and automation. While their development and deployment continue to evolve, concerns regarding misuse underscore the importance of responsible implementation and ongoing vigilance in the digital landscape.
